# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Hi There!

  I recently completed an internship at Tesla in their Environmental,Health,Safety and Security divison.I worked with Vitoria Staniszewski, Aniket Pujari and others, working on analyzing Safety Events data and conducting Job Hazard Analysis to enhance workplace safety!
